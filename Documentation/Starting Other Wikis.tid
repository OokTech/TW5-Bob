description: Serve multiple wikis at the same time.

This works using the `wsserver` command included in this plugin.

''Note:'' This describes how to make the Bob plugin serve existing wikis.
If you want to create the wiki and start serving it you should look at
[[creating new wikis|$:/plugins/OokTech/Bob/Creating New Wikis]] instead.

You can start serving other wikis from within the wiki. First you need to give
the wiki a name and list its path in the settings. Go to the `Bob Settings`
tab in the [[$:/ControlPanel]] and give the wiki a name and list its path in
the `wikis` section like this:

`'otherwiki': ~/Documents/TiddlyWiki/Wikis/Bob`

then click the `Update Settings` button under the list. Wait a moment for the
save button to turn back to grey and then click on the `Update Routes` button
and your changes should take effect. It may take a few seconds for the server
to finish processing the requests.

Afterward you will be able to go to `localhost:8080/otherwiki` to open the wiki
(assuming that you are using default settings)

''Note:'' This does not create the wiki. If the wiki doesn't exist this won't
do anything. To create a new wiki from within the wiki use the interface in the
$:/ControlPanel under the Bob tab. If for some reason you would rather do it
some other way see the example for the
[[runScript message|$:/plugins/OokTech/Bob/WebSocketMessage-runScript]].

<!--
!! Serving wikis using a script (Advanced)

Using the [[runScript|$:/plugins/OokTech/Bob/WebSocketMessage-runScript]]
websocket message you can run shell commands, so you can do this to start
serving other wikis normally from within a wiki.

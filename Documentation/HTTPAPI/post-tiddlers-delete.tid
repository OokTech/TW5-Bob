description: Delete one or more tiddlers from a wiki

This is POST instead of DELETE because in general nothing but the url should
be needed for a DELETE request, but because there is both a wiki name and a
tiddler name that have to be given the url parsing would be ambiguous unless
there were restrictions on wiki or tiddler names.

The POST body should be a JSON object in the form:

```
{
  tiddlers: [title1, title2, ...]
}
```

If the POST body is larger than 1MB it will be rejected.
But if you have enough tiddlers in a wiki that their titles take up more than
1MB you may want to consider a database solution.
